# Shyaru

Shyaru is a project help me to excavated some necessary knowledge about how to build a basic compiler or interpreter.

At now, what was implemented is just a prototype or something maybe you'd like call it as a demo. But, as you see,
anyway, it can be run! Maybe I could extra write a line to my resume...

Shyaru is component by a parser and an interpreter. The former translate string to abstract syntax trees. And the latter
interpret ast and run it.

Some basic operators and Grammars which any languages contained were implemented even if the way to implement shyaru was
 inelegant, or ugly ---- ok, I know it absolutely.

Shyaru is written in python.

The name Shyaru comes from one girl's name.
